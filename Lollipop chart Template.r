On several tracks, the players considerably improved the time needed to complete three laps when they used shortcuts (*Choco Mountain*, *D.K.'s Jungle Parkway*, *Frappe Snowland*, *Luigi Raceway*, *Rainbow Road*, *Royal Raceway*, *Toad's Turnpike*, *Wario Stadium*, and *Yoshi Valley*). Actually, for three out of these tracks the previous records were more than halved since 2020 (*Luigi Raceway*, *Rainbow Road*, and *Toad's Turnpike*). Four other tracks still have no records for races with shortcuts (*Moo Moo Farm*, *Koopa Troopa Beach*, *Banshee Boardwalk*, and *Bowser's Castle*). Are there none or did nobody find them yet? Pretty unrealistic given the fact that since more than 24 years the game is played all around the world—but maybe you're able to find one and obtain a new world record?",
